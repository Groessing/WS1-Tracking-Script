# WS1-Tracking-Script
This script, originally developed during an internship at Greenpeace CEE and adapted here with sensitive data removed, was initially run in Google Apps Script. This script connects to Workspace ONE via API, fetches all devices, filters only Windows devices with activity in the last 14 days, and records key device information in a Google Sheet for easy tracking and analysis.
